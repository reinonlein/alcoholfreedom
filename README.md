# Welcome behind the scenes of the Alcohol Freedom app!

[Always and everywhere Alcoholfreedom.life](https://www.alcoholfreedom.life)

Welcome to the landing page of the one and only Alcohol Freedom app in the world! The readme you are reading now is part of [this Github repository](https://github.com/reinonlein/alcoholfreedom/tree/master/), where you can follow the key steps in the development of this app . For the enthusiasts among us, here is the most important code and source files for this app.

My minimum requirements for the first version of this app are to make all stories of Alcohol Freedom mobile accessible initially. The most important functionality is a tracker to keep track of how long you have stopped drinking, how much money you have saved, and much more. This, plus the basic layout, will make the first build version ready for production. I'm excited!

In the future I have many other features in mind for this app. These include:

- That you can keep a diary
- A mood tracker
- Reminders why you wanted to quit again
- Possibly a chat box / forum
- A social element, in which you can support your quit buddies
- Vote for new features
- Unlock achievements
- Comparisons on stop time, money, etc.
- Various performance and layout improvements

But all in due time! First make sure that this new gem can be downloaded in the app stores.

You will notice it yourself and read all about it on this page!
