## Because quitting alcohol can also just be fun!

#
#
#
Welcome to the Alcohol Freedom app! This app is a self-made, mobile version of the online site at [Alcoholfreedom.life](https://www.alcoholfreedom.life), expanded with a cool alcohol-free stop tracker and countless cool new features in the pipeline.
#
Because of course not everyone is familiar with Alcohol Freedom, here's a simple FAQ to clarify things.
#
#
#
#### **What is Alcohol Freedom about?**
Alcohol freedom is about (you guessed it) the freedom of an alcohol-free life, and everything that comes with it. The term alcohol freedom was invented for the realization that you can also let go of the habituation and the enormous freedom that you then get in return. It represents a life where you don't just think you can relax with a drink, but find other ways that turn out to be just as effective and relaxing. Alcohol freedom is a turnaround that can bring you a lot, but then you have to dare to take that exciting leap into the deep end. This app is your armband in this exciting time!
#
#
#
#### **What is the purpose of Alcohol Freedom?**
The goal is to convince more people to take the brake of their lives for once. I know from my own experience that the benefits of quitting are many times greater than the benefits of drinking, and I want to share that liberating experience with as many people as possible. So if I can inspire even 1 person to take that exciting step, my mission is more than successful.
#
#
#
#### **Did you drink that much yourself?**
Pretty. At one point I was actually just addicted to beer, to a point that I could function just fine with it, but in the meantime I was tapping away many six packs with all the unnecessary situations that entails. I've had a wonderful time with beer, but I like this new non-alcoholic chapter in my life so much that I wish I had pulled the brakes years earlier. But luckily you are never too old to learn!
#
#
#
#### **Is this yet another self-help site?**
No, that's definitely not the point. There are plenty of good informative websites about quitting with alcohol, addiction and the harmful effects that alcohol can have, but this website is not (primarily) about that. I just want to emphasize the sunny side at the end of the tunnel here. I think the best way to really quit drinking is to really want to. I try to get people to do that with this positive site and app.
#
#
#
#### **Is Alcohol Freedom an Organization?**
Alcohol Freedom is in no way affiliated with any organization or government. It was created purely out of joy and enthusiasm for this subject. Alcohol freedom is therefore a one-man initiative, started spontaneously on the bus to work in May 2019. Why not?
#
#
#
#### **Huh, a one-man initiative? How?**
The content is (for now only) written by me: Rein, a 36-year-old guest from Haarlem. Because I enjoy writing a lot, I started in 2018 to write something nice every day for my other ambitious website [Wateengast.nl](https://www.wateengast.nl). Since I stopped drinking alcohol for a year on New Year's Eve in 2018, I suddenly had all the time, energy and motivation to do this every day. And because I was so proud of that, I wrote about it and it turned out to be surprisingly successful. Coincidentally, I'm also a crazy geek who loves to program, so this seemed like a great topic for an app. Hence this result!
#
#
#
#### **But who is Rein then?**
Well, that's me. Rein, an ordinary guy from Haarlem, who can often be found online under the corny pseudonym Rein Onlein. I have a family with 2 little boys and a job as a Data Scientist at the largest airport in the Netherlands. I like programming and I like to write, which is quite a golden combination if I do say so myself. This means that I can, for example, program a complete app myself, which I can then also provide completely with content myself. All strings in their hands, or to sum it up lyrically incorrectly: The sky and the time are the limits.
#
#
#
#### **What else can you do?**
On my website [www.reinonlein.nl](https://www.reinonlein.nl) you can see which skillset I have worked with. I want to add a portfolio and work experience to that, in the hope that in the future I will be able to slowly take on more and more freelance jobs. Could you by any chance use some help in Text/Flutter/Python/Data Science/BI tools or even Excel? I would like to help you! Send me [an email](mailto:contact@alcoholfreedom.life) and we'll make it right.
#### **Do you make money with Alcohol Freedom?**
No, not yet. At least, I once received 78 cents commission on a book sale via an affiliate link to Bol.com, and that was about it. Fortunately, that's not the point at all! My goal is to build a fun information platform with hopefully a loyal online community one day. If that catches on, I'm sure an advertiser will cross my path at some point.
#
#
#
#### **Can I advertise on alcohol freedom?**
That is allowed, but not in a way that we bother people too much with it. Just send me [a non-binding email](mailto:contact@alcoholfreedom.life) with your proposal, and I'll be happy to discuss all the options with you.
#
#
#
#### **Will there be annoying advertisements in this app soon?**
Don't worry: not that! What I certainly don't want is to sell my site for clumsy banners and annoying in your face advertising. I also always want to continue to offer this app ad-free and free, purely because I myself prefer not to pay for an app and find it very disturbing when all the advertising flashes on the screen. I do want to build in a donation function to get a little something back for the many hours I put into it, but I still have to see how and what that is all about.

#
#
#
#### **Do you write all the lyrics for Alcohol Freedom yourself?**
Yes! The only exception are the experience stories. There I have the great honor that other people naturally put their answers to the questions on paper. That leaves me with the simple task of editing, copying, anonymizing and publishing everything. Full credits to the authors! But yes, besides that everything comes from our own pen. That does not alter the fact that I also like to hear from other writers on this platform, so if you have a story: [let me know!](mailto:contact@alcoholfreedom.life)!
#
#
#
#### **When will new content be written and posted?**
At the moment I'm busy making this app, and because of that I have a little less time to write. Moreover, I already write a piece every day for my corny website [Wateengast.nl](https://www.wateengast.nl), so time is my biggest enemy here. But that doesn't change the fact that I have agreed with myself to publish a new story every weekend! If it all catches up a bit, Wednesday will be added soon. Stay tuned and keep watching often!
#
#
#
#### **Can I use your texts on my website?**
No problem, nice even, but I would like to be informed and a source reference to [https://www.alcoholfreedom.life](https://www.alcoholfreedom.life) in return. That way I also benefit from the algorithms of the major search engines.
#
#
#
#### **Can I also write for Alcohol Freedom?**
Love! I think it would be nice if people want to contribute to this platform as guest bloggers. Send me [an email](mailto:contact@alcoholfreedom.life) and we'll make it happen!
#
#
#
#### **How ​​can I contact you?**
If you have any questions about Alcohol Freedom, if you have a tip, idea, suggestion, proposal, complaint or compliment, it's best to email me at [contact@alcoholfreedom.life](mailto:contact@alcoholfreedom.life). I will do my best to contact you personally as soon as possible!
#
#
#
#### **What's planned for the future?**
In terms of content, I want to focus on the experience stories in the coming period. I find those are the most fun to do and I think readers will benefit the most from them. There are still many new features on my wish list for the app. I will publish that list, but at the top are at least these applications:

- That you can keep a diary
- A mood tracker
- Reminders why you wanted to quit again
- Possibly a chat box / forum
- A social element, in which you can support your quit buddies
- Vote for new features
- Unlock achievements
- Comparisons on stop time, money, etc.
- Various performance and layout improvements
