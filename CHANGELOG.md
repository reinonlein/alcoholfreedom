Welcome to the changelog of the one and only Alcoholfreedom-app! Here, I'll keep you posted on the latest changes and implementation of all new features. The ideas I have for this app are plenty, so please stay tuned for more alcohol-free awesomeness to come!

## **1.0.0** First Launch!
#### Release: TBD
- This app is developed by a single dude in the Netherlands, and was released earlier in the Dutch name "Alcoholvrijheid". Most work for the launch thus involved translating code, achievements and menu texts. This was quite a big task and took me over a couple of weeks to complete, and I did not even start on translating the beautiful texts on the blog that will be linked later!
- Also a lot of documentation and screenshots are required to launch a new app in an app store. This was included in this version as well.
