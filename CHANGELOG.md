## **1.1.0** Added currency selector
#### Release: July 17, 2021
- With this update I lay the foundation for internalization of this app. By saving the locale, we can make a country-specific experience in the future
- Also, I added the currency selector to have the saved money achievements make more sense.

## **1.0.1** Ios Launch!
#### Release: July 7, 2021

## **1.0.0** Android Launch!
#### Release: July 1, 2021
- This app is developed by a single dude in the Netherlands, and was released earlier in the Dutch name "Alcoholvrijheid". Most work for the launch thus involved translating code, achievements and menu texts. This was quite a big task and took me over a couple of weeks to complete, and I did not even start on translating the beautiful texts on the blog that will be linked later!
- Also a lot of documentation and screenshots are required to launch a new app in an app store. This was included in this version as well.
- I had to create a Git repository and landing page to log all changing text documents
