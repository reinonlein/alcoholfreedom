Welcome to the changelog of the one and only Alcoholfreedom-app! Here, I'll keep you posted on the latest changes and implementation of all new features. The ideas I have for this app are plenty, so please stay tuned for more alcohol-free awesomeness to come!

#  
## **1.2.0** Added the personal quitting stories
#### Release: August 12, 2021
- One of the best ways to keep you motivated in quitting alcohol, is by realizing that you are not alone in your struggles. Every week, I'll add a new inspiring real-life story from somebody who has chosen to quit alcohol. Please enjoy!

#  
## **1.1.0** Added currency selector
#### Release: July 17, 2021
- With this update I lay the foundation for internalization of this app. By saving the locale, we can make a country-specific experience in the future
- Also, I added the currency selector to have the saved money achievements make more sense.

#  
#  
## **1.0.1** Ios Launch!
#### Release: July 7, 2021
- Yes! Alcoholfreedom is made for iOS now, so you can enjoy it on your iPhone or iPad from now on. One giant leap for appkind!

#  
## **1.0.0** Android Launch!
#### Release: July 1, 2021
- This app is developed by a single dude in the Netherlands, and was released earlier in the Dutch name "Alcoholvrijheid". Most work for the launch thus involved translating code, achievements and menu texts. This was quite a big task and took me over a couple of weeks to complete, and I did not even start on translating the beautiful texts on the blog that will be linked later!
- Also a lot of documentation and screenshots are required to launch a new app in an app store. This was included in this version as well.
- I had to create a Git repository and landing page to log all changing text documents
